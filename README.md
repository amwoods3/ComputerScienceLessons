# About

This git repository is just a look at some things that I have learned in Computer Science.
I will go over concepts such as Algorithms, Data Structures, Artificial Intelligence, and
anything else that I found interesting. I will provide explanations and sample code of 
each thing.

# Why

I am using this to help me review the algorithms I have learned. I will also attempt to
solve more algorithms that I don't have the direct answer to. This will allow me to get a 
feeling for how figuring out how such problems work. I also hope to use this to learn
more about topics that I find interesting such as some discrete mathematics problems,
probability theory, machine learning, and search.
